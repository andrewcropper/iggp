Alquerque is a game played on an 5x5 grid. Red pieces on the bottom two rows of the board and black pieces on the top two rows of the board. Pieces can move forward one step along lines connecting vertices or can jump over and capture an opponent's piece provided there is an empty square on the opposite side. Each player gets 10 points for each piece captured. The game terminates on move 60 or when one of the players has no more pieces to move.
