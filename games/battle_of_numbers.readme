Battle of Numbers is a game played on a 5x5 rectangular board. Team red starts on the left column, and team green starts on the right. Each team has five number fighters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Only one fighter is permitted on a square at a time. An opponent's fighters can be captured diagonally only. Generally, a number can "eat" any smaller or equal number, except that number 1 can eat 5 but 5 cannot eat 1. The winner is the player with the larger number of fighters at the end of the game.
